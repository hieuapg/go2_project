      <h2>Mobile Robotic Carriers for Oxygen Therapy</h2>
      <p>
        Early work emphasized mobile carts or walker-like carriers
        for transporting oxygen equipment. <a href="https://robomechjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40648-016-0053-3" target="_blank">Iribe et al.</a> developed
        a robotic cart with a two-DOF handle interface for home
        use, showing that reducing manual carrying effort encourages
        patients to walk longer distances. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014140" target="_blank">Kinugasa et al.</a> explored
        robotic following in public spaces and demonstrated feasibility
        in outdoor settings. While these solutions reduce the physical
        burden of carrying oxygen cylinders, they leave the connecting
        tube unmanaged, exposing patients to potential entanglement
        and tripping risks.

      <h2>Tethered Follower Robots</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347341843_A_Control_Strategy_for_a_Tethered_Follower_Robot_for_Pulmonary_Rehabilitation" target="_blank">Bianchi et al.</a> introduced a tethered follower robot for
          pulmonary rehabilitation that uses a cable tension sensor to
          follow patients during supervised sessions. <a href="https://eudl.eu/doi/10.4108/icst.pervasivehealth.2012.248596" target="_blank">Ohira et al.</a>
          proposed a networked shuttle walking model to encourage
          exercise adherence. These approaches treat the tether primarily
          as a sensing modality rather than a controllable element.
          Active cable regulation—maintaining appropriate slack and
          preventing hazards—remains largely unexplored.</p>

      <h2>Rehabilitation-Oriented Assistive Robotics</h2>
      <p>Other researchers have investigated robot-assisted gait training and autonomous follower systems for rehabilitation [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362512927_Design_of_Autonomous_Following_Vehicle_for_Rehabilitation" target="_blank">link</a>].
        These platforms typically operate in controlled environments
        and focus on path following and patient tracking rather than
        handling a deformable connection such as an oxygen tube.
        Cable routing, slack regulation, and patient interaction with
        furniture or cluttered home environments are generally not
        considered</p>

      <h2>Cable Manipulation and Human-Robot Interaction</h2>
      <p>Cable and hose manipulation has become an active benchmark problem in robotics, with approaches ranging from
          reinforcement learning for routing and knot tying [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40648-016-0054-6" target="_blank">link</a>], [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40648-016-0054-6" target="_blank">link</a>] to
          vision-based threading [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13439" target="_blank">link</a>] and planning-based methods for
          constrained routing [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40648-016-0054-6" target="_blank">link</a>]. Other studies leverage simulationto-real transfer for tasks like insertion and untangling [18].
          However, most methods assume static endpoints or fully
          known workspaces, and few involve a human actively moving
          one end of the cable. These methods are optimized for
          task completion rather than continuous slack management in
          dynamic scenarios.</p>

      <h2>Motivation and Gap</h2>
      <p>From the literature, three key gaps remain: (1) oxygen
        tube slack is rarely treated as a controllable variable, (2) few
        systems integrate multi-modal perception (vision + LiDAR)
        for robust tracking in unstructured home-like spaces, and
        (3) predictive adjustment of cable slack to anticipate human
        motion has not been studied. Our proposed system aims to address these gaps by combining wide-field RGB-D perception,
        real-time patient tracking, obstacle-aware cable routing, and
        predictive slack regulation using a mobile quadruped platform
        equipped with a hook-shaped gripper.</p>
