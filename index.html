      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Elderly patients who require supplemental oxygen rely on bulky oxygen generator systems, which significantly hinder their mobility and independence within indoor environments. The burden of manually transporting these devices reduce activity levels, lower quality of life, and pose a risk of serious injuries. The main objective of this project is to design and develop a robotic oxygen generator carrier that autonomously accompanies patients, enabling seamless and safe navigation. This system aims to provide continuous mobility assistance through affordable, safe, and easily operate robotic technology. By reducing the physical demands on patients and promoting independence, the carrier has the potential to improve long-term health outcomes, reduce the risk of falls or injuries, and alleviate the burden on caregivers.
        <br>While additional developments and testings are needed, preliminary work indicates that robotic assistance for oxygen delivery is both feasible and impactful in enhancing elderly patients care.
