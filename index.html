      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) patients often
        rely on portable tanks connected via nasal cannulae or tubing,
        which introduces mobility constraints and tripping hazards. We
        present a mobile robotic system that actively regulates oxygen
        cable slack while following the patient, improving safety during
        daily activities. The system combines a Unitree Go2 quadruped, a
        lightweight 6-DoF arm with a hook-shaped gripper, dual Intel RealSense D435 cameras with vertical image stitching for wide-field
        RGB-D perception, YOLO-Pose for patient localization, and a
        Hesai XT-16 LiDAR for obstacle detection. A predictive controller
        is proposed to anticipate patient transitions (sit–stand–walk) and
        reduce tension spikes by dynamically routing the cable. We plan
        to evaluate the system in a clinical-like environment to assess
        its ability to maintain safe slack, avoid obstacles, and follow
        patient motion. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility
        of deploying perception-driven, predictive cable management for
        LTOT patients in hospital or home settings.
